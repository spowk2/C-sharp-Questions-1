###Q: What is a namespace?

They are for organizing classes into different sections so nothing interferes with anything its not supposed to.

###Q: What are value types?

Value types are just the types a value classifies itelf as. Examples of value types are int, float, char, etc.

###Q: What are reference types?

A reference type refers to another location in memory for the data stored in a variable rather than being a variable that stores information itself.

###Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?

It's to make property declaration more concise and it's useful because it allows for there to be less code that is also more efficient. 

###Q: What is the purpose of using statement?

To choose which namespaces will be used in the program. Similar to how you would use prototypes or libraries at the top of a C program to show that you are using those functions. 

###Q: What are dynamic type variables?

You can store any type of value in dynamic data type variables but more importantly, they can be changed or unknown at run-time.

###Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?

It determines if an object instance or expression result can be changed to a specified type.

###Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?

Generics is a class which lets the user define classes and methods with placeholder. It allows for type-safe data structures.

###Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?

It can accessed during the whole runtime.

###Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

Yup.

###Q: How do you sort an array?

Out of the several ways, the most common way would be to just use Array.Sort(). 

###Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

You can assign a null as a value to type variables. 

###Q: What is an enumeration?

An enumeration or "enum" is a set if named integer constants.

###Q: What is inheritance?

You can make a class with the same structure and rules as a previously made class which allows for faster programming. 

###Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?

No.

###Q: What is the purpose of as operator

It tells the compiler to perform a certain operation.

###Q: What is an object?

An instance of a class that is created dynamically.

###Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?

Structs: Contain value types.
Classes: Classes are reference types.

###Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?

Break will stop the loop or switch while continue skips one or more statements in a loop or switch then moves to the next iteration

###Q: What is this and how is it used?

It refers to a current instance of a class. Used as a modifier in the first parameter.

###Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?

Try runs a block of code that may cause an exception and catch is there to handle the exception.

###Q: How is exception handling done?

With catch.

###Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?

Finally is a code that executes after try and catch. The purpose is to release the system resources.

###Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

Array is static nature while ArrayList is dynamic nature.

###Q: What is an object?

An instance of a class that is created dynamically.

###Q: Define constructor.

A constructor is a special method of the class that is automatically invoked when a instance of a class is made.

###Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?

Can be declared at method scope and the compiler will determine the type.

###Q: What is an abstract class?

Class with a blueprint for derived classes.

###Q: What is an interface?

Declares the property and methods used in the child class.

###Q: What is a method?

A group of statements that work together to run a task.

###Q: What is a property?

A member that provides a flexible tools to read and write the value of a private field.

###Q: What is an access specifier?

Keywords that help specify accessibility of a type and its members.

###Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?

Private: Limits the accessibility of a member to within the defined type. 
Public: Has no limits on accessibility. 
Internal: When class members are accessible within the assembly. 
Protected: When inheritance is used. 
Protected Internal: Combination of protected and internal.

###Q: What is a collection?

The way which objects are handled in the program.

###Q: What is a Hash Table?

Representation of a collection of key and value pairs that are organized based on hash code of the key.
